Tools used in different project to fill the gap from missing features that are handy:
* Real JS tables (using tabulator.js)
* Using a sort of "crude" crud in turn using persistent class and form
* Additional form elements

This is not production ready for a generic use but right now it is working in some specific case and is due to evolve
depending on it usage.
